This is a basic todo list web app done by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this we can add our work, remove, edit it, while adding the task's the value of the tasks get increase by one but initially it is zero. Click on your task if it is completed it would strike off the task and decrease the value in the pending task, if you try to add an empty input in the list it throws and exception this is how it works.
